# Heledone visual asset set

Generated with the built-in ImageGen tool for the Heledone southern-Iran visual system.

- `avatar-01.png` … `avatar-10.png`: selectable default profile portraits. The profile page converts a selected portrait to the existing profile upload payload, so the choice persists through the normal account API.
- `coastal-welcome.png`: dashboard welcome panorama.
- `palm-corner.png`, `palm-sunset.png`: palm and sunset compositions for navigation, empty states and landing sections.
- `boat-lenj.png`: traditional Persian Gulf boat cutout.
- `shenashir.png`, `coastal-house.png`: Bushehr coastal architecture and shenashir motifs.
- `sea-divider.png`: restrained wave separator.

`sea-divider.png` separates language preferences from administration modules and finishes the Home and Projects content; it also appears in wave-themed empty states. `palm-corner.png` decorates palm-themed empty states (Projects, Settings and Discounts), as well as the existing task activity empty state. Login uses the dedicated transparent `login-workspace-v1.png` background; registration keeps its plain form layout. All artwork remains retained in the project.

- `login-workspace-v1.png`: hand-painted southern coastal work desk and shenashir window, with transparent space for the sign-in form. Full-bleed background on desktop; a short illustration above the form on smaller screens. Generated with the built-in ImageGen tool. Final prompt: [login-workspace-prompt.md](./login-workspace-prompt.md).

The assets use the palette `#FFF8EE`, `#087F83`, `#DF765B`, and `#F2BA49`; decorative imagery is kept independent from semantic status colors.

- `home-welcome-v2.png`: bright shenashir and sea panorama matched to the home reference.
- `home-sidebar-coast.png`: transparent flat coastal scene for the home sidebar.
- `projects-coastal-v1.png`: dedicated Projects panorama, used by the project list and detail headings. Generated and composition-edited with the built-in ImageGen tool.

Projects final prompt: preserve the traditional lenj and teal waterfront workshop, extend the harbor, sea and sandy shore through the left two thirds, and keep only the rightmost third near-white. Bright turquoise, coral and sun-yellow; no people, text, logos or watermark.

## Page-specific Coastal Panoramas

All new panoramas use the built-in ImageGen tool, not the CLI. Their scenes fill approximately two thirds of each image; only one third stays quiet for interface copy. The collection varies between open sea, sand dunes, rock pools, mangroves, coastal crafts and architecture.

Shared empty-state artwork also uses this new collection; existing user avatars are unchanged. The exact final prompt set is recorded in [coastal-prompts.md](./coastal-prompts.md).

Home uses `home-welcome-v2.png` again, with `home-sidebar-coast.png` in the sidebar and `coastal-welcome.png` in the personal workspace. All generated images are retained in the project regardless of current usage. Ten earlier compositions are preserved under [variants/](./variants/README.md), alongside the nineteen final panoramas in this directory. Do not remove unused illustrations during asset cleanup.
